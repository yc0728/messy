I plan to use the books:  
Abstract Algebra by Dummit and Foote  
Algebra: Chapter 0 by Paolo Aluffi  
Baby Rudin  
Big Rudin  
Maybe, Functions of one complex variable by Conway    
I am excited to start reading! But meanwhile, I am also a little bit worried as the past qual exams seem difficult...Hopefully things go well :) ALso, hope tonight Liverpool can win..
