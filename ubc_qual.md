I plan to use the books:  
Abstract Algebra by Dummit and Foote  
Algebra: Chapter 0 by Paolo Aluffi  
Baby Rudin  
Big Rudin  
Maybe, Functions of one complex variable by Conway    
I am excited to start reading! But meanwhile, I am also a little bit worried as the past qual exams seem difficult...Hopefully things go well :) ALso, hope tonight Liverpool can win..

I back home for almost two weeks. I am in a class for a driving license (C1). Tomorrow will be the Subject 1 test. I also studied for the qual exam since April 8. In general, I am satisfied with my current life. But I have to say, I can do much better! I can study way longer than now. Hopefully, after passing the Subject 1 test, I can work harderrrrr!   
PS: there is a surprising result for finite groups: There is a unique fixed point free order 2 automorphism for finite groups, i.e. $g\mapsto g^{-1}$. And there is none for non-abelian groups!
