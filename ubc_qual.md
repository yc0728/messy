I plan to use the books:  
Abstract Algebra by Dummit and Foote  
Algebra: Chapter 0 by Paolo Aluffi  
Baby Rudin  
Big Rudin  
Maybe, Functions of one complex variable by Conway    
I am excited to start reading! But meanwhile, I am also a little bit worried as the past qual exams seem difficult...Hopefully things go well :) ALso, hope tonight Liverpool can win..

I back home for almost two weeks. I am in a class for a driving license (C1). Tomorrow will be the Subject 1 test. I also studied for the qual exam since April 8. In general, I am satisfied with my current life. But I have to say, I can do much better! I can study way longer than now. Hopefully, after passing the Subject 1 test, I can work harderrrrr!   

PS: there is a surprising result for finite groups: There is a unique fixed point free order 2 automorphism for finite groups, i.e. $g\mapsto g^{-1}$. And there is none for non-abelian groups! I dont know if this result is still true for infinite groups, since in the proof, I do use the fact of finiteness. Hint from Dummit & Foote: If $\psi$ is a fixed point free order 2 auto, then for all g in G, $g = x^{-1}\psi(x)$ for some $x\in G$. This can be proved by showing that $x\mapsto x^{-1}\psi(x)$ is a bijection from $G\to G$. The bijection comes from the injection and the finiteness.

A few days ago, I was reading the baby rudin. There is an amazing result: Let $\sum a_n$ be a series that converges non-absolutely. Let $-\infty\leq\alpha\leq\beta\leq\infty$. Then there exists an rearrangement, $\sum a^{'}_n$ with partial sum $s_n^{'}$, such that $liminf s_n^{'} = \alpha$ and $limsup s_n^{'} = \beta$.
